# Prescryption
An idea for a blockchain based solution for health care &amp; prescription fulfillment.

UML Diagrams to explain the architecture of this solution can be found in this repository 

# Stakeholders
The Stakeholders in the blockchain network would be
1) Patients
2) Doctors
3) Pharmacies

# Tracking Medical Records
The motivation of this project came from UDACITY BLOCKCHAIN NANODEGREE P6 which required us to build a supply chain solution 
for food/cloth or any asset.
Prescryption utilizes the transparency of Blockchain to keep a record of medical history of patients for and uses IPFS protocol
to persistently store the medical records.

# Benefits
Prescryption allows for better healthcare as future doctors would be able to access the medical records of patients once an 
appointment is booked by the patient hence allow for better healthcare.
 
Prescryption would also allow government to monitor the shipping of authentic medication from state controlled pharmacies.
